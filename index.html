        <h2>Why am I here?</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of this page is for personal use. I want to practice
          programming and record some interesting news about tech.
        </p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>What can I find here?</h2>
        <p>
          There are 4 pages now, and each can be accessed using the navigation
          bar on top of this page. I plan on expanding my website in the future.

      <div class="reminder">
        <h2>How can I upgrade my skills using this website?</h2>
        <p>
          I don't really know the answer now, but I think we should read and
          practice as much as possible. Following the useful websites can help.
          Also, contributing to open-source projects and looking at codebases
          help us improve our coding style and thinking.
